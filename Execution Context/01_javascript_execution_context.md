# Javascript Execution Context
**Abbreviations** \
`GEC` --> Global Execution Context\
`FEC` --> Function Execution Context\
`MCP` --> Memory Creation Phase\
`EP` --> Execution Phase

* _Javascript execution context refers to how a piece of code in javascript gets executed_

* _There are mainly 2 contexts_
    1. `Global execution context`
    2. `Function execution context`

_There is one more context we will see when we will learn Mongoose, which is_ `EVAL execution context`

***
`Global execution context`
* Global execution context is inseperable whether its browser, node, deno or bun
* GEC takes your javascript code into {} and you can access it via `this` keyword.

`Function Execution Context`

_Function Execution stage has 2 phases_\
    1. `Memory Creation Phase`  
    2. `Execution Phase`

* Memory Creation phase cycle will always run
* First of all when you define a variable it creates a memory of that variable and enters it value as undefined
* Then in Execution Phase the allocated memory spaces gets the actual value instead of undefined

``` javascript
let val1 = 5 
// Firstly in MCP val1 will be undefined and then in execution phase 5 will get stored in val1
let val2 = 8 // Same logic as above

function addTwoNum (num1, num2){ 
    let total = num1 + num2
    return total;
}
``` 
* Since `addTwoNum()` is not a variable, it is a function hence instead of undefined the definition of function will get stored inside of `addTwoNum()`
* The function will then create it's own sandbox whenever it is called, in that sandbox both phases will repeat
* After the execution of function this temporary sandbox gets deleted.

`Note :-` _Always look at when the function is defined not at where it's called to understand context_

``` javascript
addTwoNum(val1, val2) 
// MCP --> val1 = undefined, val2 = undefined, total = undefined
// EP --> val1 = 5, val2 = 8, total = 13 // Since we are returning the total it gets transferred to GEC


addTwoNum(10, 6) 
// MCP --> num1 = undefined, num2 = undefined, total = undefined
// EP --> num1 = 10, num2 = 6, total = 16 (total gets returned to GEC)
```
