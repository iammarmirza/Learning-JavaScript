# Arrow Function
_When you write a function like this it is called as an arrow function_
``` javascript
hello = () => {
    return "Hello World"
};
console.log(hello())

// This is called explicitly defined arrow function and writing return is compulsory if you are using curly braces
```

_If our line of code can fit in one line then there is no need to use curly braces and explicitly defining arrow function_

``` javascript
addTwoNumbers = (num1, num2) => (num1 + num2) 
console.log(addTwoNumbers(8,9))

// This is implicitly define arrow function and we didn't have to use return keyword just because we are using paranthesis
```
