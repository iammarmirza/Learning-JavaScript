// If and else are conditional statement when we want a code to execute differently on two different conditions

if(condition){

}
// if condition inside paranthesis will be true the the code will execute
// If there are only two conditions then you can also use else
else(condition){

}
// Only one of them will execute

// you can also use if elseif elseif else for more than two conditions

// You can also add more than on condition in if or else using logical operators
// && --> code will execute if both the statements are true
// || --> code will execute if only one of the statements are true
