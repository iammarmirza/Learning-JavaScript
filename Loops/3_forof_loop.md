# For of loop
These loops are array specific loops.
* ["","",""]
* [{ },{ },{ }]

``` javascript
const arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
// Iterators can be anything not only object but strings and arrays are also iterable
for (const num of arr) {
    console.log(num);
}
```
``` javascript
const greetings = "Hello World!"
for (const greet of greetings){
    if ( greet === " "){
        continue
    }
    console.log(`Each Char is ${greet}`);
}
```

### How to use for of loop on Map

``` javascript
const map = new Map()
map.set('IN', 'India')
map.set('USA', 'United States of America')
map.set('FR', 'France')
console.log(map)
```

**We can't run for of loop on map like**
``` javascript
for (const key of map) {
    console.log(key)
}
``` 
* It will print the whole thing in different arrays
* If we want to print the values independently there is a different syntax

``` javascript
for (const [key, value] of map) {
    console.log(`${key} :- ${value}`) // Both of the console logs works the same
    console.log(key, " :- ", value)
}
```

* But we can't use for of loop on object with the same syntax as Map

``` javascript
const myObject = {
    game1 : "NFS",
    game2 : "GTA",
    game3 : "God of War"
}

// Not Working
for (const key of myObject) {
    console.log(key)
}

// Not Working
for (const [key, value] of myObject) {
    console.log(key, value)
}
```


**In the end we can't use for of loop on object**
